My name is Gosia and I am Junior Quality Assurance. 
I spent most of my career in graphic design, running my studio. During this work, I not only designed but also analyzed the client's needs, documented them, and ensured quality in every aspect of product development - from the idea to printing or electronic publication. 

Me in few words:
   -  thorough and sensitive to detail,
   -  highly motivated to acquire new skills and qualifications,     
   -  prepared to expand my knowledge in the field of software testing.
